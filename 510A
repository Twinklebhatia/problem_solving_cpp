Fox Ciel starts to learn programming. The first task is drawing a fox! However, that turns out to be too hard for a beginner, so she decides to draw a snake instead.

A snake is a pattern on a n by m table. Denote c-th cell of r-th row as (r, c). The tail of the snake is located at (1, 1), then it's body extends to (1, m), then goes down 2 rows to (3, m), then goes left to (3, 1) and so on.

Your task is to draw this snake for Fox Ciel: the empty cells should be represented as dot characters ('.') and the snake cells should be filled with number signs ('#').

Consider sample tests in order to understand the snake pattern.

#Input
The only line contains two integers: n and m (3 ≤ n, m ≤ 50).

n is an odd number.

#Output
Output n lines. Each line should contain a string consisting of m characters. Do not output spaces.

Code:
#include<bits/stdc++.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
	int m,n;
	cin>>n>>m;
	for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
	{
		for(int j=1;j<=m;j++)
		{
		if(i%2==1)
		cout<<"#";
		else if(i%4==2 && j==m )
		cout<<"#";
		else if(i%4==0 && j==1)
		cout<<"#";
		else
		cout<<".";
		}
		cout<<"\n";

	}
	return 0;
	
}
